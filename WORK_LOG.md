Main idea I'm currently working on is an approach that utilizes tabulation to create a 2D array with the lengths being the size of the two strings and to use the longest previous run to determine new one if the two characters are equal or not when being compared. |
| Feb 27  |  8:15-8:45am  | Changed my program so that none of the checks for double counting or anything like that are in place and it managed to pass the first small test. Obviously for the medium test it didn't work, but spent the 30 minutes ideating about ways that I can fix this problem and try to use some sort of list of how everything was added to fix it. For example, I would keep a list called visited that's the length of the first word and holds the index of the letter from the 2nd string that was used to check off the corresponding letter from the first string. With this, the only condition is that if the space is taken, do not increase the current run length by 1 unless the current index is greater than the previous one listed in the visited list, and the index of the letter before the current one is greater than the index currently placed in the visited list. Using this, it would allow me to swap out the index to a later letter to increase the length of the current string. |

Was essentially just the idea of only allowing each letter to be paired once on a row and then to store the index of the letters that mapped together in an array to make sure they can't be selectted again, but it just didn't work. |

Description of what I did is basically the same, |

Currently, the idea was to store all the indicies of each occurence of each letter inside an array and then iterate through it finding the longestIncreasingPath by using heatingUp algorithm. | |

Simplifies program and completed within 10minutes or so, spending the rest of the time adding comments. |
