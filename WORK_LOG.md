| Feb 25  | 11:25-11:55 | Worked during class to come up with a couple idea of how to solve this problem. Main idea I'm currently working on is an approach that utilizes tabulation to create a 2D array with the lengths being the size of the two strings and to use the longest previous run to determine new one if the two characters are equal or not when being compared. |
